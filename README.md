Assignment for Tom and James:
Work on big-integer: 1. Fibonacci number (check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Assuming that it begins with 1 instead of 0. 2. Factorial (check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial). Assuming that it begins with 1 instead of 0. 3. Prime number (check:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number). The first prime number is 2.

As a result, when I call the function Fibonacci(i), it should return the ith Fibonacci number with i >= 1. The same case for Factorial and Prime number.

You should know how to "export" a module in node.js. Then, you should a demo program to demonstrate the way to require('aaa'), where aaa is the name of the function that you have named. I know a little bit, but not a lot. You learn it and teach me and other students.
